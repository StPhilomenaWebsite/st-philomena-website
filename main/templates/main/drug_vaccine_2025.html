The targeted age group is <strong>9 to 18 years</strong>. The campaign is scheduled to run between <strong>27th October to 3rd November, 2025</strong>.</p>

  <p>As part of the campaign, <strong>deworming (praziquantel and albendazole)</strong>, <strong>HPV</strong> as well as <strong>IFA supplementation medication</strong> will be administered to all students.</p>

  <p>The campaign is designed to protect our students from parasitic and viral infections and improve their overall health and academic performance. Health professionals from the Ministry of Health will oversee the administration of the medication to ensure everything runs smoothly and safely.</p>
